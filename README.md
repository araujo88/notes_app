# notes_app
 
Integration between front-end written in React.js and back-end written in Django for a simple notes web app.

Instructions:
 - On the "backend/mynotes" folder, run the Django server with "python manage.py runserver". This will run a local API server on port 8000.
 - On the "frontend/mynotes" folder, run the React app with "npm start". This will run the web app on port 3000.
